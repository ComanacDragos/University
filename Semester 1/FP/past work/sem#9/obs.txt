how do we implement undo/redo?
    1. Remember what we need to do for undo/redo
    (remember = what function to call and which parameters)
    
    2. Remember the order in which operations were made
    (remember = keep a list of program operations)

    3. Carry out the operations when user requests undo() redo()
    (call the right function with the right parameters)
