		-  here the number of simulations is computed to reach a given err and alpha
 	- special method to generate Poiss -> poiss_special
	- rejection method to approximate pi -> rejection_to_aprox_pi
	- forecasting new software release -> forecasting_software_release
		- errors found
seminar 4 Markov chains
