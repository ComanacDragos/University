Text understanding from scratch
 - using deep learning to handle text clasification
 - no syntactic or semantic structures associated
 - temporal ConvNets
 - CNNs do not require knowledge of words
 - works on character level

Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification
 - simple CNN
 - uses word representations from word2vec
 - performs well on several datasets

Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification
 - recurrent structure to capture as much contextual information as possible
 - captures better the semantic compared to simple recurrent neural networks
 - bi-directional recurrent structure
 - max-pooling that automatically judges which features are most important
 - O(n) complexity where n is the length of the text
