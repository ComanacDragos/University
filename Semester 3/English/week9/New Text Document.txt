better navigation practices

- users want to do as little work as possible to find their stuff  

1. clear text labels
 
2. Structure matches user mental model

 
3. Clear wayfinding give context and explanations 

when users make mistakes don't force them to start over 



The drivers's attention is drawn away from the circulation signs and the other participants in trafic 
due to the use of mobile phones or navigation systems or other gadgets unrelated to driving which leads to more 
accidents







4. A website shouldn't make use of frames due to the fact that they can be misleading and because of the browsers
which don't support them

5. A website should't change the place or the availability of different navigation elements upon using them because
such operations can be misleading.

6. On a website it should take no more than around four cliks to get to a specific information, and if needed
the website should be readjusted to meet this criterion because users don't want to spend too much time in finding
what they want.
