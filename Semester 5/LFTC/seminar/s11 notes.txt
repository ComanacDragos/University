SLR and LR(1)

SLR we do not have
just an action for a state
it is possible to have
different actions based
on prediction

enrich grammar
number productions
compute cannonical collection
build lr0 table
	lines -> states
	columns: action, terminals and non temrinals

. at the end means reduce 
except for starting symbol


for SLR structure of table changes
lines-> states
columns: action for
terminals and $
GOTO for non terminals


acc is on the column of $





Elements of LR(1)
have item and prediction
