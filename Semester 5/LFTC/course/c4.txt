regular sets are right linear 
languages

(for any regex there exists an
equivalent right linear language

L1 and L2 right linear
=> L1 U L2, L1L2, L1* are right linear

hw at course might be at the exam


concatenation
if A->aB in P1 
=> A->aB in P4

if A->a in P1
=> A-aS2 in P4


if p in P2 => p in P4



Theorem

a language is a regular set 
if and only if is a right
linear language


grammar - solve system for
starting symbol

finite automata - solve for final
state (union for solutions for
final states)
